### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my MTech Thesis where I try to utilise multi sensor remote sensing data to automate Change Detection using Deep Learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Foundational Models and Metric Learning
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that includes a problem that needs a solution
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing as I believe in finding solutions by searching myself.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I will give you an answer (need not be correct, or incorrect for that matter as you yourself do not know which is why you asked me in the first place)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Look to the sky and yell out my name. Jk, email me at advaith29042002@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him. But I can't control what you call me, nor will I try to. Wait, I just tried by providing my pronouns.
- âš¡ Fun fact: We are all just collections of experiences and conditioning done by our environment. Is there truly a rigid core to us humans?
